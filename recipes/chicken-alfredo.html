                        <h2>Steps</h2>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Bring a large pot of water with 1 tablespoon of salt to a boil.</li>
                            <li>Meanwhile, add 1 cup heavy cream and the butter to a large skillet. Melt over medium-low heat and allow the mixture to reduce by one third, about 5-10 minutes.</li>
                            <li>Once the sauce is reduced, turn the heat off and add the remaining 1/2 cup of heavy cream to the skillet. Season with the remaining salt and pepper.</li>
                            <li> Add the pasta to the boiling water. Cook according to the manufacturer's directions for ‘al dente’ pasta, about 2-3 minutes.</li>
                            <li>Transfer the cooked pasta directly into the skillet with the heavy cream sauce. Reserve the pasta water.</li>
                            <li>Turn the heat to low and add the parmesan and nutmeg to the pasta. Cook the pasta and sauce for about 1-2 minutes, stirring with tongs, until the cheese is melted.</li>
                            <li>Add about 1/4 cup of the reserved pasta water to the sauce. Once again, stir with the tongs until the sauce is glossy and coats the pasta.</li>
                            <li>Serve.</li>
                        </ol>
